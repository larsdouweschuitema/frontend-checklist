# Frontend checklist

This is a technology stack agnostic checklist and therefore it does not care about what framework you decide to use.

## Why?

Frontend is extremely complicated. There are (too) many topics to cover for a single person as part of a development team.
This checklist helps reducing the failure by compensating for potential limits and human memory and attention. It helps
to ensure consistency and completeness.
